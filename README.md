## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Senior Engineer with a unique dual-background. I combine the mathematical rigor of Structural Engineering with 3+ years of building production-grade Full Stack applications. Currently at TechnipFMC, I dont just write code; I architect internal tools that automate complex subsea analysis, enforce 100% test coverage, and migrate legacy systems to modern, type-safe standards.
